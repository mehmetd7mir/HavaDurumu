This is a simple weather application developed using Swift and UIKit.

## 🌐 Features

- Search weather by city name
- Real-time data from OpenWeather API

- Light/Dark mode support

## 🧠 What I Learned

- API integration using `URLSession`
- JSON decoding using `Codable`
- Error handling and optional unwrapping
- UI design with `Storyboard`
- Light/Dark Mode

## 🔐 Note

The real API key is not included in this repository for security reasons.  
Please replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in `WeatherManager.swift` with your own key from OpenWeather.
